ZANU won 57 out of 80 Common Roll seats in the new parliament, with the 20 white seats all going to the Rhodesian Front.
 
Mugabe, whose political support came from his Shona-speaking homeland in the north, attempted to build Zimbabwe on a basis of an uneasy coalition with his ZAPU rivals, whose support came from the Ndebele-speaking south, and with the white minority. Mugabe sought to incorporate ZAPU into his ZANU led government and ZAPU's military wing into the army. ZAPU's leader, Joshua Nkomo, was given a series of cabinet positions in Mugabe's government. However, Mugabe was torn between this objective and pressures to meet the expectations of his own ZANU followers for a faster pace of social change.
 
In 1983, Mugabe fired Nkomo from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in the Ndebele-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Mugabe accused the Ndebele tribe of plotting to overthrow him after sacking Nkomo. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in the provinces of Matabeleland and the Midlands, leaving Mugabe's rule secure. Mugabe has been accused by the BBC's Panorama programme of committing mass murder during this period of his rule, after the show investigated claims made by political activist Gary Jones that Mugabe had been instrumental in removing him and his family from his farmland. A peace accord was negotiated in 1987ZAPU merged into the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) on 22 December 1988. Mugabe brought Nkomo into the government once again as a vice-president.
 
President
 
In 1987, the position of Prime Minister was abolished and Mugabe assumed the new office of executive President of Zimbabwe gaining additional powers in the process. He was re-elected in 1990 and 1996, and in 2002 amid claims of widespread vote-rigging and intimidation. Mugabe's term of office expired at the end of March 2008, but he was re-elected later in 2008 in another election marred by allegations of election fraud and intimidation.
 
Mugabe has been the Chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe since Parliament passed the University of Zimbabwe Amendment Bill in November 1990

he is not the strongest man in the party. In fact, he is very weak. ODS has suffered from an internal split in several ways there's a Klaus-loyal faction, former PM Topolanek faction although he does not hold any party or public position now, both of which dislike each other but also dislike Necas;s faction (as represented by the current leadership after 21st congress). Further, several of the local chapters have resisted central ODS's steering, such as Prague (which is currently cooperating but this will not last too long), Brno, South Bohemia.

Closest Necas's adviser and ally is Alexandr Vondra, defense minister, former EU minister in Topolanek's government. He has traditionally acted as the link to the US interests in the country. He joined politics back before the revolution, closely cooperating with Vaclav Havel, whose foreign-policy adviser he became later. 1997-2001 he served as the ambassador to the US. Within ODS, he supported Topolanek first (against Vaclav Klaus - note that Havel and Klaus have traditionally disliked each other). After the collapse of the government in 2009 and an internal crisis he dumped Topolanek and is with Necas since 2010.

The strongest minister in the current government is Miroslav Kalousek, finance minister, deputy chairman/de facto leader of TOP 09.
- also formerly at the defense ministry, which his former party KDU-CSL has traditionally controlled until the last election round in 2010
- his good friend is Richard Hava, whose children control his arms dealer company Omnipol. Hava's interests are, however, much wider, including Czech Forests,energy (CEZ and gas-fired Uzin plant, lately- photovoltaic), and decontamination of old environmental damages (note that the finance minister devised a gigantic single tender for all the clean-up works in 2008, which he then had to abandon for now).

President of Djibouti
Born November 27, 1947, in Ethiopia; son of Omar Guelleh and Moumina Rirache; married; children: four.

Addresses: Office â€”Office of the President, La Presidence BP 6, Djibouti, Republic of Djibouti.

Began career as a civil servant with the French colonial administration of Djibouti, 1968, and rose to become a police inspector by 1970; worked as an independence activist for Lingue Populaire Africaine pour l'independence (LPAI), a pro-independence political group, after 1975; launched pro-independence newspaper, Djibouti Today , and served as a foreign delegate representing the LPAI cause until 1977; served as chief of staff to President Hassan Gouled Aptidon, c. 1977-99; elected president of Djibouti, 1999; reelected, 2005.

Sidelights
First elected to office in 1999, Guelleh was reelected to another six-year term, but was the sole candidate in the election.

Born in 1947, Guelleh originally hails from Dire-Dawa, a city in Ethiopia. He was born into the Mamassans clan of the Issa, who are also known as Somali and are an indigenous group of the Horn of Africa, as the area surrounding Djibouti is called. 

In his youth, Guelleh attended a traditional Islamic school, and entered the civil service in 1968, when it was still under French colonial administration. He rose to the position of police inspector, but quit in 1975 to join the independence movement. Djibouti's push for self-rule was organized around the Lingue Populaire Africaine pour l'independence (African People's League for Independence, or LPAI), which was headed by his uncle, Hassan Gouled Aptidon. Guelleh worked for the LPAI, ran his own pro-independence newspaper, and even traveled abroad to advocate for Djibouti's independence. When that occurred, Aptidon became president, and Guelleh served as his chief of staff for the next 22 years. He also had special responsibility for overseeing the domestic-security forces.

By 1979, LPAI had evolved into a political party, the Rassemblement Populaire pour le ProgrÃ¨s (Peoples' Rally for Progress, or RPP), and Guelleh held positions within the party as well as his other posts in the government. But the earliest years of independence in Djibouti were marked by hostilities, with the majority Issa gravitating toward the RPP, which dominated the country. 

Guelleh took on an increasing list of duties for his uncle, who was 81 years old when he won reelection again in 1997, as the president's health declined. He was named his successor when Aptidon formally stepped down in 1999, and Guelleh bested opponent Idris Moussa Ahmed in a presidential election called that year.

From 1978 to1985 he held the position of Scientific Secretary at the Matenadaran (Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts) and from 1985 onwards was a Senior Researcher there. He is fluent in Armenian, Russian, French, English, German, and Arabic as well as several dead languages. He has authored over 70 scientific research papers which have been published in Armenian, French, and Russian, dealing with Armenian medieval translated literature and Armenian-Assyrian cultural linkages. His exhaustive two-volume historical-political study of the Cilician Armenian period entitled, The Crusaders and the Armenians (published in 2005 and 2007), paves a new direction in the scientific study of history and serves as a new methodology for the study of Armenian history. In 2006, a collection of Ter-Petrossian's speeches, articles, and interviews on politics and political science was published, entitled Selected Works.

Levon Ter-Petrossian was made a member of the USSR Orientalists' Association in 1985, the Armenian Writers' Union in 1988, the French Asiatic Society in1989, and the Mkhitarian Academy of Venice in 1991. He has been awarded Honorary Doctorate degrees from the University of La Verne in 1990, the University of Sofia in 1994, the Sorbonne in 1996, and the University of Strasbourg in1996.

Levon Ter-Petrossian is the founding president of the Republic of Armenia and a politician and statesman who enjoys wide international recognition. His political activity began in the 1960's; he was arrested in 1966 and detained for one week for participating in an April 24th demonstration. Beginning in February 1988, Ter-Petrossian led the local Karabakh Committee at the Matenadaran and in May of that year he joined the Karabakh Committee of Armenia, becoming one of its most authoritative and influential members. He presented a program of action in a series of public addresses in which he offered insightful analysis of the current situation and potential future developments. On December 10, 1988, he and other Committee members were arrested and spent six months in Moscow's Matroska Prison.

During the years of the Karabakh movement, Ter-Petrossian penned over 100 political leaflets which were distributed on behalf of the Karabakh Committee and the Armenian National Movement as well as decisions which were adopted by the Supreme Council of the Armenian SSR thanks to the pressure brought to bear by the Committee. He was elected a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR in 1989 and a member of the Presidium in July 1990. In May 1990 he was reelected deputy to the Supreme Soviet and on August 4 of the same year he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR. On October 16, 1991 he was elected President of the Republic of Armenia with an overwhelming majority of votes (83.4%). He was reelected President on September 22, 1996. From 1991 to1995, along with Babken Ararktsyan, he chaired the Constitutional Committee of the Supreme Council and drafted a constitution that was adopted on July 5, 1995 in a nationwide referendum.

He is the leader of the left-wing party Direction â€“ Social Democracy (Slovak: SMER â€“ SociÃ¡lna demokracia). The party won the parliamentary elections in 2006, receiving approximately 30 percent of the cast votes. After the victory he created a coalition with the Slovak National Party an extremist[1][2][3] nationalist party[1][2][4] led by JÃ¡n Slota and with the People's Party - Movement for a Democratic Slovakia led by VladimÃ­r MeÄiar.
Life and career

Fico was born in a working class family on September 15, 1964, in the town of TopoÄ¾Äany. His father was a forklift operator and his mother worked in a shoe store. Fico has two siblings, brother Ladislav and a sister Lucia. He is married to a wife Svetlana, they have one son together.

Fico acquired his legal education during the communist rule in then-[[Czechoslovakia\\. He graduated from the Law Faculty of the Comenius University at Bratislava and later worked for the Institute of State and Law of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, a communist take on a think-tank body. Fico joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1987.

After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, following the collapse of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, Fico joined the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), a successor of the Communist Party of Slovakia. From 1994 to 2000 Fico as a political appointee represented Slovakia as its legal counsel at the European Court of Human Rights. During this time Fico lost all 14 cases he handled.[5]

In 1999 Fico left his SDL party whose support had meanwhile dropped below the threshold required to get into parliament. Subsequently he founded a new party called SMER (Direction). Although at first presented as a centrist party, the Fico's new party project soon shifted towards a more extreme and populist leftist rhetoric,[citation needed] the part of the political spectrum having been left vacant after the disintegration of Fico's previous SDL party.

Fico soon became one of the most popular opposition politicians in Slovakia. His rhetoric was most often aimed at the ongoing reforms being carried out at the time by the right wing government of MikulÃ¡Å¡ Dzurinda. Although praised by international politicians, institutions and economists alike,[6][7] Dzurindaâ€™s reformsâ€™ short-term negative impacts increased the appeal and popularity of Fico's populist rhetoric, particularly among the countryside population, elderly, lower social classes, and voters with a lower level of education, which to this day make up the majority of his electorate.[citation needed]

In the parliamentary elections of 2002, Fico's SMER received 13.46% of the votes and became the third largest party. The result was much lower than the pre-election estimates and Fico openly called it a failure. In the following four years Fico continued with his sharp anti-reform and populist rhetoric, gradually increasing his party's numbers in opinion polls.
[edit] 2006 Government Coalition

In the elections in 2006 SMER won with 29.1% of the votes and formed a coalition government with VladimÃ­r MeÄiar's HZDS and JÃ¡n Slota's SNS.

In addition to MeÄiar's and Slota's controversial political past, Slota and his nationalist and anti-Hungarian SNS party presented a problem of its own, especially in light of Fico's SMER party's attempt to present itself as a modern, socialist and pro-European party. JÃ¡n Slota has been known for his frequent vulgar, defamatory and hatred-inciting anti-gypsy and anti-Hungarian remarks,[8] including a drunken public speech in which he called for Slovaks to ""get in tanks and level Budapest to the ground"".[9][10]

As a result of Fico's decision to form government with Slotaâ€™s extremist SNS, the EU-wide Party of European Socialists suspended Fico's party application to join them. In late February 2008 however the Assembly of PES partially reversed this decision, conditionally reinstating the application after both SMER and SNS sent the PES a signed letter, committing themselves to respect minority rights. Slotaâ€™s numerous nationalist and hate inciting remarks[11][12] made since have gone largely ignored by the PES and have not effected SMERâ€™s application.

Fico himself has never publicly criticized or condemned Slota's remarks and speeches and as an obvious result of JÃ¡n Slota's conduct the government-level relations between Slovakia and the neighbouring Hungary deteriorated to an unprecedented level. Several meetings between two countries' prime ministers were abruptly canceled and those few that did take place resulted in little progress or improvement of relations.[13]
[edit] 2010 Election campaign
See also: Slovak parliamentary election, 2010

Before the 2010 elections, Fico's party, seeking reelection was in a relatively strong position according to several polls. However just before the election a political scandal broke out, described as one of the gravest in the country's 17-year history.[14] A voice recording surfaced in which a voice strongly resembling Fico's [15] claims that he raised several million euros in undeclared funds for the 2002 election as well as calling for a ""parallel financial structure"" to be created for the financing of Smer's election campaign. Slovak media sources such as SME carried the news about the recording in great detail, however Fico dismmissed it as forgery.[14] Fico also attacked the media sources that published information about the recording, saying ""Should I go over there and give you a smack because you are scoundrels? What you are doing is unheard of. You are masturbating on the prime minister every day.""[14] Fico has since been interrogated on this, SME announced. Daniel Lipsic told the press he handed the recording to the general attorney office.

In the election, Fico's SMER remained the biggest party in Parliament, with 62 seats. However, his coalition partners were decimated, with the HZDS being completely shut out. Unable to find a partner willing to given him the 14 seats he needed to stay in office, Fico resigned. He said he ""respects the election result"" and expressed his desire to lead a resolute opposition after his narrow loss. [16]
[edit] Domestic policy
Robert Fico meeting with Serbian President Boris TadiÄ‡.

A large part of Ficoâ€™s election victory was largely attributed to his loud criticism of the previous right-wing governmentâ€™s economic, tax, social, pension and legislative reforms. The reforms were generally perceived as very positive and successful by such international bodies as IMF, the World Bank or the OECD,[17] however they negatively affected certain segments of the population, particularly low wage earners, the unemployed, and welfare and other social assistance recipients.

While in opposition, and primarily during the election campaign, Fico vowed to reverse and cancel the majority of the reforms, however upon taking the office he adopted a substantially more cautious approach. Fico inherited the economy in an excellent condition which was generally attributed to the said reforms. The country was achieving a record-high GDP growth and it was starting to fulfill the Maastricht criteria required for the Euro currency adoption, for which the country was aspiring at the time (Slovakia eventually adopted the euro currency on January 1, 2009 as third of the former Soviet-block countries).

As a result, contrary to his numerous pre-election promises and declarations, Fico implemented only a few changes that were deemed mainly cosmetic and did not substantially change any of the reforms. According to analysts, the likely reason for Fico's turnaround from his election promises was the realization of the catastrophic consequences the cancellation of the reforms would have on the economy.[18] In retrospect Slovakia seems to now have a balance between the free market and some social protection.

The most successful reform Fico did introduce was in establishing some reasonable standards in how many times employees may be kept on as temporary workers instead of being given permanent contracts. Under the one-sided, pro-employer legislation of the Mikulas Dzurinda government an employer could (and many did) keep new staff as temps and create a two-tier workforce. Generally Slovak labour regulation is in tune with most other EU states.

One of few modifications Fico's government did implement was a slight modification to the unconventional and economist-praised flat tax system introduced by the previous government in a way that slightly decreased or eradicated a tax-free part of income for higher income earners. Presented as a millionaire tax to Fico's electorate, the tax change essentially impacted everyone earning over â‚¬1200 a month, yet had minimal or no impact on those earning over â‚¬3000 a month. A lower VAT was imposed on medications and books, though in spite of his election promises Fico failed to extend this onto a wider group of products such as groceries. The Economic crisis of 2008-9 seems to have stopped efforts for more progressivity in the tax system.

Among the more radical measures were controversial legislative changes which effectively banned private health insurance companies from generating profit. As a result Slovakia is being sued by several foreign shareholders of local health insurers through international arbitrations.[19]

In health care, Fico abolished fees that people had to pay when visiting a doctor or a hospital, introduced by the previous government, however no further much-needed reforms have been carried out in the health care system since, resulting in a record high system debts and numerous hospital closures.[20]

In 2007, Fico unsuccessfully tried to regulate retail food prices, an unprecedented effort in a generally free market European union.[21] His legislative measures however failed due to various loopholes that were essentially impossible to close without violating fundamental free market principles.

In August 2008, Fico threatened the foreign shareholders of a local gas distributor SPP, the French Gaz de France and the German E.ON, with nationalization and seizure of their ownership shares in a dispute over retail gas price.[22][23]

Fico is an active proponent of nuclear energy.

In 2010 Fico faced large scale protests and a blockade of major cities by truckers upset by badly implemented toll on first class highways. Truckers demanded that the price of fuel be reduced to compensate for the toll.[24] Fico first refused to speak with representatives of the truckers, saying ""he won't be blackmailed"", a few days later he capitulated giving in to the demands. The tax cut given to truckers will amount to about 100 million EUR.[24]
[edit] Foreign policy
Robert Fico with Mirko CvetkoviÄ‡ during the state visit to Serbia

In foreign policy, Fico and his government have faced substantial difficulties in achieving political acceptance abroad, mainly due to his coalition with the controversial and internationally isolated parties of VladimÃ­r MeÄiar and Jan Slota.

Fico himself created several controversies, for example having attended a reception organized by the Cuban Embassy in Bratislava commemorating an anniversary of Castro's revolution, or announcing that one of his first foreign trips would include Libya, China or Venezuela.[25]

Compensating his lack of close political allies within the EU (head of the Czech social democrats Jiri Paroubek being a notable exception), Fico has been actively strengthening relations with several non-EU countries such as Serbia or Russia. For example Slovakia modernized Russian MiG-fighters in Russia and did not buy new NATO-standard jets in the West.[26] Additionally Fico condemned Georgia in 2008 for the aggression against South Ossetia.[27]

Fico is an opponent of the planned construction of new US ABM and radar systems in military bases in the neighbouring Czech Republic and Poland (also criticized by Russia)[28] and one of the first steps upon taking the office was a military pullout from Iraq.

Robert Fico has strongly opposed unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo, as a result of which Slovakia has not recognized Kosovo as a sovereign state.
[edit] Ficoâ€™s views on Communism

One of Ficoâ€™s famous remarks is his comment on his perception of the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully brought down the communist regime in Czechoslovakia and helped bring down the Soviet rule in all of Eastern Europe. He has been quoted saying as â€œnot having noticed it (the revolution) due to being busy at workâ€ (at the communist ministry of justice) and he has referred to the Velvet Revolution as â€œan ordinary coup that did not influence his life in any visible way."" [29]

Fico has often defended the communist regime as being more social than the capitalist one. Fico has remained unapologetic about his membership in the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia prior to the regime's collapse. He also mentioned in a radio talkshow that he has not noticed a significant progress since the Velvet Revolution.
[edit] Fico and the media

Fico is known for his hostile and often bumpy relationship with the media. During his press conferences he often verbally attacks, lectures and taunts the present journalists, often accusing them of bias and attacks on his government. On several occasions he has openly and on record used profanities against specific journalists (â€œidiotsâ€, â€œpricksâ€).[30][31]

Fico often sues media for libel. Although most of his lawsuits are aimed at tabloids, he has also sued broadsheet dailies (SME, Pravda) as well as an economic weekly Trend. He has won several of the lawsuits, while others have been dismissed. As of March 2009 Fico has more than 10 pending libel lawsuits with a tabloid weekly Plus 7 Days alone. Some of Fico's lawsuits are based solely on a headline, or a satiric cartoon. Several of the court judgments have raised serious concerns about the freedom of press in Slovakia, especially in the cases when besides an apology Fico had also been awarded substantial financial compensatory damages.

Since taking up the office as a prime minister, Fico has granted only one press media interview, to tabloid daily Novy Cas. Although a frequent participant in televised political debates prior to the elections, since then he has only attended televised shows with no political opponents present.

In his ongoing feud with the media, Fico has often been quoted as suggesting that the government should own and operate its own media outlets to assure ""objective"" information about the government.

Fico often tries to dictate to the media what they should cover, and subsequently taunts them when they don't. Fico has on several occasions issued a bizarre and unusual apologies to several foreign politicians, whose visit of Slovakia Fico felt were largely ignored by the media. One such example was the visit of the Russian prime minister Zubkov in April 2008. Most media did not consider the visit of the virtually unknown Zubkov substantially newsworthy hence only minimal coverage was done. To make matters worse, during the press conference the journalists were not allowed to ask any questions. Subsequently Fico sent Zubkov a letter of apology where he apologized for the Slovak media's lack of interest in his visit",26383,SMER - Social Democracy,No,Apex,Chairman,Predseda,No,Political advisor,Executive,Prime Minister,PM or equivalent,,2016-01-01,2016.0,1,,,,0,,Member of Parliament,,,2010-01-01,,5,,,,0,,"Cabinet, Minister",Deputy Speaker,,2010-01-01,2016.0,2,,,,0,,1,2016-01-01

- his power derives from nostalgic free-marketeers within ODS
- his power base includes the Prague lawyer Karel Muzikar, Prague ODS (current leader Boris Stastny) and thus the majority of Prague ""business"" world
- note also his regular defense of Russian interests (missile shield, NATO & EU criticisms, promotion of mutual economic cooperation, trips to Moscow...)


In CSSD, the formal leader will be chosen next weekend, but regardless of whether its Hasek or Sobotka, lawyer Miroslav Jansta is the key decision maker.

The power of these lawyers (and of all similar eminence grise) rests in their ability to write up contracts and devise ways to finance the party and selective party members (which increases their power).



Curriculum Vitae
VÃ¡clav Klaus

* June 19, 1941


Czech economist, politician and President of the Czech Republic

Vaclav Klaus was born in the Vinohrady district of Prague on June 19, 1941. He spent his childhood and youth in the neighbourhood of Tylovo namesti square.

He obtained his university education at the University of Economics, Prague (majoring in the Foreign Trade Economics and graduating in 1963), and economics thus became his specialist field for his entire life. He took advantage of the relative liberalisation in the then Czechoslovakia in order to study in Italy (1966) and the USA (1969). As a research worker at the Institute of Economics of the Czech Academy of Sciences he completed his postgraduate scientific studies and in 1968 was awarded the title of app. PhD. in Economics.

In 1970 he was forced to abandon his research career for political reasons, and left to work at the Czechoslovak State Bank for many years. In 1987 he returned from the bank to his academic work at the Prognostic Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences at the end of 1987.

Immediately after the events of November 17, 1989 he entered politics, but did not lose contact with the world of economic science. He continued to lecture and publish occasionally, and in 1991 he was engaged as a lecturer at Charles University in the field of economics. In 1995 he was appointed professor for the field of finances at the University of Economics, Prague.

He embarked on his political career in December 1989, when he became Federal Minister of Finance. Later, in October 1991 he was appointed vice chairman of the government of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic. At the end of 1990 he became the chairman of the then strongest political entity - the Civic Forum. Following its demise in April 1991 he co-founded the Civic Democratic Party, of which he was chairman from its inception until December 2002. He won a parliamentary election with this party in June 1992 and became Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. In this role he shared in the ""Velvet Divorce"" of the Czechoslovak Federation and the foundation of an independent Czech Republic. In 1996 he successfully defended his post as Prime Minister in election to the Chamber of Deputies. Following the collapse of the governing coalition he tendered his resignation in November 1997. Following a forced general election in 1998 he became chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech parliament for a four-year period.

On February 28, 2003 he was elected President of the Czech Republic. On February 15, 2008 he was elected President of the Czech Republic.

Vaclav Klaus is married to the economist Livia Klausova and has two sons and five grandchildren. His son Vaclav is the headmaster of a private grammar school in Prague, and his son Jan works as a financial analyst.

For many years in his youth Vaclav Klaus was top sportsman, playing basketball and volleyball, and also enjoys skiing and playing tennis. In his free time he enjoys reading fictitious literature and listening to music, in particular jazz.

He has published over 20 books on general social, political and economic themes, and has been awarded a number of international prizes and honorary doctorates from universities all over the world.",70601,Civic Democratic Party- ODS,No,Top ten,co-Founder,spoluzaložil,,Political advisor,Executive,President,,,2003-01-01,,1,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,0,,1,2003-01-01

Prior to his Presidency, President Tadic served, from March 2003 to April 2004, as the Minister of Defence of Serbia and Montenegro.

As Minister of Defence, President Tadic earned an international reputation as a great and effective reformer. He demonstrated extraordinary leadership and courage in dramatically overhauling the Ministry, instituting democratic reforms and transforming the military, thus laying the groundwork to provide Serbia with the necessary tools to meet future challenges at home and abroad. In particular, President Tadic was instrumental in establishing a modern, rapid reaction force under strict civilian control and reorganizing the Ministry and General Staff to be NATO compliant.

Since becoming President of the Republic of Serbia in 2004, President Tadic has consolidated Serbiaâ€™s democracy and become the international spokesman of the â€œnew Serbia.â€ Serving as his countryâ€™s â€œambassador of businessâ€, President Tadic has led numerous trade delegations abroad; has actively promoted the â€œde-Balkanization of the Balkansâ€ by taking the initiative in reconciliation efforts as well as by encouraging an increase in regional trade; and has vigorously re-forged a strategic partnership - based on common principles and interests - between Serbia and countries such as the United States, the member-states of the European Union, Russia and China. In particular, President Tadic has been a strong advocate of Serbiaâ€™s full and rapid integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Lastly, he has been a forceful advocate of a strategic solution to the challenge of Kosovo and Metohija - a solution that takes seriously the interests of all the legitimate stakeholders in the Serbian provinceâ€™s future.

President Tadic had previously held numerous political and governmental posts, including that of Minister of Telecommunications in the months following the 5 October democratic revolution that overthrew the regime of Slobodan Milosevic. In addition, after serving two terms as the Deputy Leader of the Democratic Party, President Tadic was elected the Leader of the Democratic Party on 22 February 2004, succeeding the assassinated Prime Minister of Serbia, Dr. Zoran Djindjic.

The son of a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and a professor of child psychiatry, President Tadic was born in Sarajevo on 15 January 1958. He attended elementary and secondary school in Belgrade, and graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade with a degree in social psychology. A long-time fighter for liberty, democracy, and human rights, President Tadic joined Serbiaâ€™s nascent anti-communist dissident movement in the 1980s and was arrested and imprisoned several times by the then-communist authorities.

President Tadic also worked as a teacher of psychology and as a military clinical psychologist. Until 2003, he was a lecturer of political advertising at the Faculty of Drama at the University of Belgrade.

LÃDER DEL MOVIMIENTO HONOR COLORADO : NaciÃ³ en AsunciÃ³n el 5 de julio de 1956. EstudiÃ³ en los colegios Goethe, Internacional y Cristo Rey. Luego viajÃ³ a Estados Unidos para proseguir su estudios, siguiendo la orientaciÃ³n de su padre, don RamÃ³n Telmo Cartes Lind, representante de Cessna para el Paraguay. Hizo carrera tÃ©cnica en Tulsa Oklahoma de Powerplant - Spartan School of Aero (motores de aviaciÃ³n) con una pasantÃ­a en la Cessna - Wichita, Kansas.
 Ya en el aÃ±o 1975, joven a los 19 aÃ±os, comenzÃ³ sus actividades de emprendimiento comercial. En 1989 se iniciÃ³ en el sector cambiario local, actividad que dio origen a Cambios Amambay, que en 1992 se convirtiÃ³ en Banco Amambay, hoy, una de las mÃ¡s sÃ³lidas del mercado financiero nacional.

INVERSIONES CON RSE : Luego en 1994/5 entra como socio en Tabacalera del Este S.A. (Palermo) y en 1996 se establece Tabacos del Paraguay S.A. como distribuidora de sus productos; En el aÃ±o 1999, Tabacalera del Este S.A. inicia el proyecto de cultivo de tabaco virginia y desarrollo de productores en Chore (departamento de San Pedro),donde posteriormente en el aÃ±o 2002, debido a la envergadura del proyecto forma la CompaÃ±Ã­a Agrotabacalera del Paraguay S.A. para dar seguimiento al mismo y donde actualmente da trabajo a mas de 1200 familias que realizan el cultivo del tabaco, de quienes compra para su posterior industrializaciÃ³n y comercializaciÃ³n.

Luego establece otras empresas que son lÃ­deres del mercado, entre las que se destaca Bebidas del Paraguay S.A. fabricante de los productos Pulp, Puro Sol y Watts. En MoisÃ©s Bertoni (departamento de CaazapÃ¡), formo la empresa Agrocitrus del Paraguay S.A., encargada del desarrollo del proyecto de cultivo de cÃ­tricos, donde emplea mano de obra de la zona, ayudando tambiÃ©n al desarrollo de la misma.
 Sus empresas lideran el mercado local siempre con un profundo sentido de  Responsabilidad Social Empresarial (RSE).
 
APOSTÃ“ TAMBIÃ‰N AL SECTOR GANADERO : Sus actividades empresariales no solo se centraron en los sectores comerciales y financieros, sino tambiÃ©n realizÃ³ inversiones en el sector ganadero, formando las empresas Ganadera Sofia S.A., Ganadera Chajha S.A. y Ganadera Las Pampas S.A., con amplio desarrollo y gestiÃ³n en cuanto a genÃ©tica, crÃ­a y engorde en sus establecimientos.

 Actualmente, las empresas del Grupo Cartes emplean mÃ¡s de 2.000 personas y estÃ¡n presentes en diversos sectores econÃ³micos, como la ganaderÃ­a, tabacos, bebidas, transporte, comercio y banca, entre otros. Su filosofÃ­a empresarial es la gestiÃ³n, mediante equipos profesionales de alta calidad, si escatimar en inversiÃ³n, innovaciÃ³n y capacitaciÃ³n constante de sus empleados.

 La organizaciÃ³n Great Place to WorkÂ® Institute Paraguay, distinguiÃ³ en el aÃ±o 2010, a una de sus firmas, Bebidas del Paraguay S.A. (Pulp), como una de las cinco mejores empresas para trabajar del paÃ­s.

SU PASIÃ“N, EL FÃšTBOL : Desde el aÃ±o 2001, al frente del Club Libertad, empieza una etapa de innovaciÃ³n y crecimiento, que posiciona al club entre los mÃ¡s grandes del paÃ­s y de AmÃ©rica, por su trayectoria internacional. Sus objetivos apuntan a la obtenciÃ³n de tÃ­tulos nacionales y el potenciamiento de las divisiones inferiores, asÃ­ como la lucha por un trofeo continental y la edificaciÃ³n de uno de los estadios mÃ¡s modernos de AmÃ©rica.
Todo eso con la mira puesta en poner Ã©nfasis en el respeto al ser humano y la realizaciÃ³n del trabajo con la mÃ¡xima calidad posible.

En los Ãºltimos 10 aÃ±os no sÃ³lo se invirtiÃ³ en el plantel e infraestructura, sino principalmente en la formaciÃ³n integral de los â€œchicosâ€ del Club que juegan en las divisiones inferiores y cuentan con una Residencia. Se trata de la primera y Ãºnica del paÃ­s, que cuenta con 10 dormitorios, sala de estudios, estar, duchas internas y externas, quincho, parrilla y sala de computaciÃ³n.

En el 2006 se inaugurÃ³ un amplio y moderno Centro de Entrenamiento del Club Libertad, ubicado frente al local de la ConfederaciÃ³n Sudamericana de FÃºtbol. Para Libertad, los futbolistas de las divisiones inferiores representan un objetivo de primerÃ­sima importancia, que se estÃ¡ encarando como pocas veces se ha visto en el paÃ­s, con un cuerpo tÃ©cnico especializado en las categorÃ­as respectivas, que trabaja con planificaciÃ³n a largo plazo, cuidando todos los detalles para una formaciÃ³n integral del atleta.

Logros deportivos de la â€œera Cartesâ€ en el club Libertad, se pueden citar: 7 campeonatos absolutos de la AsociaciÃ³n Paraguaya de FÃºtbol (APF), entre ellos, un histÃ³rico tetracampeonato en la historia del club gumarelo (2006, 2007, 2008 apertura y clausura); a nivel continental, se ganÃ³ el respeto de sus pares debido a las buenas actuaciones en Copa Libertadores, llegando en el 2006 a la instancia semifinal y en el 2007 a cuartos de final; obtuvo uno de los mÃ¡ximos reconocimientos, con la ubicaciÃ³n nÃºmero 15 de Libertad entre todos los clubes del mundo, en los aÃ±os 2006 y el 2007.

TambiÃ©n desempeÃ±a funciones directivas en la AsociaciÃ³n Paraguaya de FÃºtbol (APF), siendo su principal actividad  la DirecciÃ³n de Selecciones, funciÃ³n que le permite trabajar de cerca con la SelecciÃ³n Absoluta de FÃºtbol, equipo que llegÃ³ a un sitial nunca antes logrado en la Ãºltima Copa del Mundo de SudÃ¡frica 2010: cuartos de final.

SU INCURSIÃ“N EN POLÃTICA : En 2009 se hizo militante del Partido Colorado, inquieto por el curso polÃ­tico del paÃ­s bajo el gobierno izquierdista-liberal filo-chavista. FundÃ³ el movimiento Honor Colorado en noviembre de 2010, que hoy participa activamente en la vida partidaria de la AsociaciÃ³n Nacional Republicana (ANR) o Partido Colorado.

Tsvangirai is reported to have been an ardent Mugabe supporter and to have risen ""swiftly in the hierarchy"", eventually becoming one of the party's senior officials. He is also known for his role in the Zimbabwean trade Union movement, where he held the position of branch chairman of the Associated Mine Workers' Union and was later elected into the executive of the National Mine Workers' Union. In 1989 he became the Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, the umbrella trade union organization of Zimbabwe. 
Tsvangirai led the ZCTU away from the ruling ZANU-PF. As his power and that of the movement grew, his relationship with the Government deteriorated. He has survived at least three assassination attempts, including one in 1997 where unknown assailants burst into his tenth story office and tried to throw him out of the window
In 1999 Tsvangirai founded and organized the Movement for Democratic Change, an opposition party opposed to President Robert Mugabe and the ZANU-PF ruling party. He helped to defeat the February 2002 constitutional referendum, successfully campaigning against it along with the National Constitutional Assembly.
Tsvangirai lost the March 2002 Presidential Election to Mugabe. The election provoked widespread allegations that Mugabe had rigged the election through the use of violence, media bias, and manipulation of the voters' roll leading to abnormally high pro-Mugabe turnout in some areas. 

Morgan Tsvangirai has been a pain in the neck for Robert Mugabe since he became Secretary-General of the ZCTU in 1998 and withdrew the union from the grip of ZANU-PF. In the absence of a strong opposition party, following the merger of Mugabeâ€™s ZANU-PF and Joshua Nkomoâ€™s ZAPU in 1987, the labour movement was viewed as a political threat to the ruling party. There was even an assassination attempt on Tsvangirai in 1997 when a group of seven tried to throw him out of his 10th floor offices.
 
Under pressure to create an alternative to ZANU-PF Tsvangirai led the ZCTU and other civic organisations to form the Movement for Democratic Change in 1999.  He was also Chairman of the National Constitutional Assembly which led the campaign to vote against the proposed new constitution, drafted by Mugabe in February 2000, marking the first defeat Mugabe had suffered since taking power.  The MDC nearly kicked ZANU-PF out of office in the June 2000 parliamentary elections when it won 57 out of the 120 elected seats in parliament
 
Mugabeâ€™s answer was to unleash unprecedented violence against MDC supporters. Tsvangirai was arrested and charged with treason but later acquitted.  He challenged Mugabe in the presidential elections of 2002 and lost, but claimed the elections were rigged. There was a serious challenge to his leadership when his top lieutenants Welshman Ncube and Gibson Sibanda led a breakaway group that wanted to contest the 2005 senate elections, which Tsvangirai had said should be boycotted. The MDC had suffered a major loss in March 2005 when it won only 41 of the 120 contested seats. Ncube walked out with a majority of the Members of Parliament, virtually becoming the official opposition. Tsvangirai was forced to rebuild the party but Mugabe never shifted his eyes off Tsvangirai because he realised he had the support of the people and continued to harass and arrest him.
 
Tsvangirai surprised everyone, including himself, when he won the presidential elections in March 2008 but his indecision on what to do next, gave Mugabe a chance to reassert himself, dispute the results and call for a re-run. Mugabe unleashed a wave of violence that saw Tsvangirai flee the country, thus giving Mugabe breathing space. When Tsvangirai
 pulled out of the re-run as a consequence of the violence inflicted on his supporters,  Mugabe went ahead with the one-candidate election and was quickly sworn in.  He could not, however, hold the country together and was forced to sign a  power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai on 15 September.
 
Tsvangirai was sworn in on 11 February. Though he has been criticised for failing to confront Mugabe head-on after his election victory, he is steadily asserting his power. His long years in the labour movement where everything had to be agreed upon by consensus could be a major setback because at times he has to go with the decision of the majority when he might not personally agree with that decision.
 
He has also demonstrated that he can withstand tremendous pressure. He has managed to contain his supporters, civic society and donors who still want vengeance against ZANU-PF. He has remained constant in his support for the inclusive government.
 
He was not even swayed by the death of his wife on 6 March, four days before his 57th birthday, though there were cries of foul play. He has also managed to contain his Secretary-General, Tendai Biti, who seems to be still playing to the gallery.  His biggest problem could come from Bulawayo where there are already two distinct factions, one supporting him and the other his deputy, Thokozani Khupe. The infighting could play into the hands of Dumiso Dabengwa, who has revived the ZAPU, which once dominated the city and the entire Matabeleland.",82711,Movement For Democratic Change,No,Top ten,President,Prime Minister of Zimbabwe,,Party organization/administration,"Cabinet, Minister",,PM or equivalent,"English, Shona, Ndebele",2008-01-01,,0,,,,0,,Executive,Prime Minister,,2008-01-01,,0,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,0,,0,2008-01-01

PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS

Mr Demetris Christofias was inaugurated President of the Republic of Cyprus on 28 February 2008 following his victory at the Presidential Elections of 24 February 2008.

At the time of his election Mr Christofias was serving his second five-year term as President of the House of Representatives, a post he held since 2001. He was first elected to the House of Representatives as an AKEL-Left-New Forces party candidate for the Kyrenia district in 1991 and was re-elected in 1996, in 2001 and 2006.

He was General Secretary of the AKEL Central Committee from 22 April 1988 to 21 January 2009. Following the death of Ezekias Papaioannou, AKELâ€™s General Secretary, on 10 April 1988, he was appointed Acting General Secretary by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the party and subsequently elected General Secretary. In 1987 he was elected on the Secretariat of the Central Committee of AKEL, in 1986 as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and in 1982 as a member of the Central Committee of the party. In 1976 he was elected member of the Nicosia-Kyrenia District Committee of AKEL.

Mr Christofias became politically active at an early age when at the age of fourteen he joined the Pancyprian United Students Organisation. In 1964 he became a member of AKEL, of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour (PEO) and of the United Democratic Youth Organisation (EDON). In 1969, at the 5th Congress of EDON, he was elected member of its Central Council. In 1974, following the completion of his studies in Moscow, he returned to Cyprus and was employed by EDON, where he was elected to the post of Central Organisational Secretary and, in 1977, to the post of General Secretary. He served at this post until 1987.

President Christofias is the recipient of many honours and distinctions including the prestigious Alexander Pushkin medal by the Russian Federation in 2007, for his contribution to the development of friendship between Russia and Cyprus and for his support of the Russian language and culture; the Great Cross of the Church of the Apostle Mark, with a star, by His Beatitude Theodoros II, Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa in 2009; the Knight of the Collar of the Pian Order by His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI in 2010; and the Order of Friendship of the Russian Federation by President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010. Moreover, he has received Honourary Degrees from a number of universities including: the University of Macedonia, in Greece (2004), the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, in Russia (2008), the University for Foreigners of Perugia, in Italy (2009), the University of Patras, in Greece (2010), the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, in Greece (2010), the European University Cyprus (2011), and the University of Mariupol, in Ukraine (2011). He was also honoured by a number of cities in several countries including Greece, Italy and Ukraine.

The President holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree in History from the Institute of Social Sciences in
Moscow (Academy of Social Sciences of the Soviet Union). He speaks English and Russian.

He was born on 29 August 1946, in Dhikomo in the Kyrenia District, in the area of Cyprus under military
occupation by Turkey since 1974.

Mr Christofias is married to Elsi Chiratou and they have two daughters and a son.
