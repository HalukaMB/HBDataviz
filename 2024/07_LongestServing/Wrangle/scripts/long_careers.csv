ZANU won 57 out of 80 Common Roll seats in the new parliament, with the 20 white seats all going to the Rhodesian Front.
 
Mugabe, whose political support came from his Shona-speaking homeland in the north, attempted to build Zimbabwe on a basis of an uneasy coalition with his ZAPU rivals, whose support came from the Ndebele-speaking south, and with the white minority. Mugabe sought to incorporate ZAPU into his ZANU led government and ZAPU's military wing into the army. ZAPU's leader, Joshua Nkomo, was given a series of cabinet positions in Mugabe's government. However, Mugabe was torn between this objective and pressures to meet the expectations of his own ZANU followers for a faster pace of social change.
 
In 1983, Mugabe fired Nkomo from his cabinet, triggering bitter fighting between ZAPU supporters in the Ndebele-speaking region of the country and the ruling ZANU. Mugabe accused the Ndebele tribe of plotting to overthrow him after sacking Nkomo. Between 1982 and 1985, the military crushed armed resistance from Ndebele groups in the provinces of Matabeleland and the Midlands, leaving Mugabe's rule secure. Mugabe has been accused by the BBC's Panorama programme of committing mass murder during this period of his rule, after the show investigated claims made by political activist Gary Jones that Mugabe had been instrumental in removing him and his family from his farmland. A peace accord was negotiated in 1987ZAPU merged into the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) on 22 December 1988. Mugabe brought Nkomo into the government once again as a vice-president.
 
President
 
In 1987, the position of Prime Minister was abolished and Mugabe assumed the new office of executive President of Zimbabwe gaining additional powers in the process. He was re-elected in 1990 and 1996, and in 2002 amid claims of widespread vote-rigging and intimidation. Mugabe's term of office expired at the end of March 2008, but he was re-elected later in 2008 in another election marred by allegations of election fraud and intimidation.
 
Mugabe has been the Chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe since Parliament passed the University of Zimbabwe Amendment Bill in November 1990

he is not the strongest man in the party. In fact, he is very weak. ODS has suffered from an internal split in several ways there's a Klaus-loyal faction, former PM Topolanek faction although he does not hold any party or public position now, both of which dislike each other but also dislike Necas;s faction (as represented by the current leadership after 21st congress). Further, several of the local chapters have resisted central ODS's steering, such as Prague (which is currently cooperating but this will not last too long), Brno, South Bohemia.

Closest Necas's adviser and ally is Alexandr Vondra, defense minister, former EU minister in Topolanek's government. He has traditionally acted as the link to the US interests in the country. He joined politics back before the revolution, closely cooperating with Vaclav Havel, whose foreign-policy adviser he became later. 1997-2001 he served as the ambassador to the US. Within ODS, he supported Topolanek first (against Vaclav Klaus - note that Havel and Klaus have traditionally disliked each other). After the collapse of the government in 2009 and an internal crisis he dumped Topolanek and is with Necas since 2010.

The strongest minister in the current government is Miroslav Kalousek, finance minister, deputy chairman/de facto leader of TOP 09.
- also formerly at the defense ministry, which his former party KDU-CSL has traditionally controlled until the last election round in 2010
- his good friend is Richard Hava, whose children control his arms dealer company Omnipol. Hava's interests are, however, much wider, including Czech Forests,energy (CEZ and gas-fired Uzin plant, lately- photovoltaic), and decontamination of old environmental damages (note that the finance minister devised a gigantic single tender for all the clean-up works in 2008, which he then had to abandon for now).

President of Djibouti
Born November 27, 1947, in Ethiopia; son of Omar Guelleh and Moumina Rirache; married; children: four.

Addresses: Office â€”Office of the President, La Presidence BP 6, Djibouti, Republic of Djibouti.

Began career as a civil servant with the French colonial administration of Djibouti, 1968, and rose to become a police inspector by 1970; worked as an independence activist for Lingue Populaire Africaine pour l'independence (LPAI), a pro-independence political group, after 1975; launched pro-independence newspaper, Djibouti Today , and served as a foreign delegate representing the LPAI cause until 1977; served as chief of staff to President Hassan Gouled Aptidon, c. 1977-99; elected president of Djibouti, 1999; reelected, 2005.

Sidelights
First elected to office in 1999, Guelleh was reelected to another six-year term, but was the sole candidate in the election.

Born in 1947, Guelleh originally hails from Dire-Dawa, a city in Ethiopia. He was born into the Mamassans clan of the Issa, who are also known as Somali and are an indigenous group of the Horn of Africa, as the area surrounding Djibouti is called. 

In his youth, Guelleh attended a traditional Islamic school, and entered the civil service in 1968, when it was still under French colonial administration. He rose to the position of police inspector, but quit in 1975 to join the independence movement. Djibouti's push for self-rule was organized around the Lingue Populaire Africaine pour l'independence (African People's League for Independence, or LPAI), which was headed by his uncle, Hassan Gouled Aptidon. Guelleh worked for the LPAI, ran his own pro-independence newspaper, and even traveled abroad to advocate for Djibouti's independence. When that occurred, Aptidon became president, and Guelleh served as his chief of staff for the next 22 years. He also had special responsibility for overseeing the domestic-security forces.

By 1979, LPAI had evolved into a political party, the Rassemblement Populaire pour le ProgrÃ¨s (Peoples' Rally for Progress, or RPP), and Guelleh held positions within the party as well as his other posts in the government. But the earliest years of independence in Djibouti were marked by hostilities, with the majority Issa gravitating toward the RPP, which dominated the country. 

Guelleh took on an increasing list of duties for his uncle, who was 81 years old when he won reelection again in 1997, as the president's health declined. He was named his successor when Aptidon formally stepped down in 1999, and Guelleh bested opponent Idris Moussa Ahmed in a presidential election called that year.

From 1978 to1985 he held the position of Scientific Secretary at the Matenadaran (Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts) and from 1985 onwards was a Senior Researcher there. He is fluent in Armenian, Russian, French, English, German, and Arabic as well as several dead languages. He has authored over 70 scientific research papers which have been published in Armenian, French, and Russian, dealing with Armenian medieval translated literature and Armenian-Assyrian cultural linkages. His exhaustive two-volume historical-political study of the Cilician Armenian period entitled, The Crusaders and the Armenians (published in 2005 and 2007), paves a new direction in the scientific study of history and serves as a new methodology for the study of Armenian history. In 2006, a collection of Ter-Petrossian's speeches, articles, and interviews on politics and political science was published, entitled Selected Works.

Levon Ter-Petrossian was made a member of the USSR Orientalists' Association in 1985, the Armenian Writers' Union in 1988, the French Asiatic Society in1989, and the Mkhitarian Academy of Venice in 1991. He has been awarded Honorary Doctorate degrees from the University of La Verne in 1990, the University of Sofia in 1994, the Sorbonne in 1996, and the University of Strasbourg in1996.

Levon Ter-Petrossian is the founding president of the Republic of Armenia and a politician and statesman who enjoys wide international recognition. His political activity began in the 1960's; he was arrested in 1966 and detained for one week for participating in an April 24th demonstration. Beginning in February 1988, Ter-Petrossian led the local Karabakh Committee at the Matenadaran and in May of that year he joined the Karabakh Committee of Armenia, becoming one of its most authoritative and influential members. He presented a program of action in a series of public addresses in which he offered insightful analysis of the current situation and potential future developments. On December 10, 1988, he and other Committee members were arrested and spent six months in Moscow's Matroska Prison.

During the years of the Karabakh movement, Ter-Petrossian penned over 100 political leaflets which were distributed on behalf of the Karabakh Committee and the Armenian National Movement as well as decisions which were adopted by the Supreme Council of the Armenian SSR thanks to the pressure brought to bear by the Committee. He was elected a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR in 1989 and a member of the Presidium in July 1990. In May 1990 he was reelected deputy to the Supreme Soviet and on August 4 of the same year he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR. On October 16, 1991 he was elected President of the Republic of Armenia with an overwhelming majority of votes (83.4%). He was reelected President on September 22, 1996. From 1991 to1995, along with Babken Ararktsyan, he chaired the Constitutional Committee of the Supreme Council and drafted a constitution that was adopted on July 5, 1995 in a nationwide referendum.

She came first in the November 2005 Presidential run-off election, involving the Liberia Soccer legend, George Weah of the Congress of Democratic Change(CDC). She won 59.9% of the valid vote cast while Weah came second with 40.1%. On 16 January 2006, she was inaugurated into office. Johnson Sirleaf is Liberia and Africa's first female head of State, elected through a democratic process. Prior to the 2005 elections, she had been deeply involved in Liberian governance and politics. In 1979 she was appointed as the first female Minister of Finance but her tenture was shortlived when Samuel Doe's military takeover ended the long-serving Americo-Liberia rule in April 1980. Five years later, when the military Junta tried to transition from military rule to civilian, she contested the senatorial seat for Montserrado and won. However, she refused to take up the seat in protest of an alledged massive vote ragging by Doe's Junta. Due to this stance, she became unpopular with the regime and fled into exile. While in exile she enmeshed herself in Diasporic politics until the implosion of Liberia in deep civil conflict. From the civil war to the Peace Conference she participated. In 1997, she contested the presidential elections which brought Charles Taylor to power. As a standard-bearer of the Unity Party, she came second. And finally, at the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement, she lost in the electoral process that decided the Transitional Head of state. After many years into exile, she returned and headed the Governance Commission until the 2005 general and presidential elections. Although she was raised as a presbyterian, she's now a member of the Liberian First United Methodist Church; the church that has produced nearly all of Liberia's presidents.",12366,Unity Party,No,Apex,Standard Bearer,Standard Bearer,No,Previous Minister,Executive,PRESIDENT,,Director of Cabinet,2006-01-01,,0,,,,0,,Executive,President,,2006-01-01,,0,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,0,,0,2006-01-01

Curriculum Vitae
VÃ¡clav Klaus

* June 19, 1941


Czech economist, politician and President of the Czech Republic

Vaclav Klaus was born in the Vinohrady district of Prague on June 19, 1941. He spent his childhood and youth in the neighbourhood of Tylovo namesti square.

He obtained his university education at the University of Economics, Prague (majoring in the Foreign Trade Economics and graduating in 1963), and economics thus became his specialist field for his entire life. He took advantage of the relative liberalisation in the then Czechoslovakia in order to study in Italy (1966) and the USA (1969). As a research worker at the Institute of Economics of the Czech Academy of Sciences he completed his postgraduate scientific studies and in 1968 was awarded the title of app. PhD. in Economics.

In 1970 he was forced to abandon his research career for political reasons, and left to work at the Czechoslovak State Bank for many years. In 1987 he returned from the bank to his academic work at the Prognostic Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences at the end of 1987.

Immediately after the events of November 17, 1989 he entered politics, but did not lose contact with the world of economic science. He continued to lecture and publish occasionally, and in 1991 he was engaged as a lecturer at Charles University in the field of economics. In 1995 he was appointed professor for the field of finances at the University of Economics, Prague.

He embarked on his political career in December 1989, when he became Federal Minister of Finance. Later, in October 1991 he was appointed vice chairman of the government of the Czechoslovak Federal Republic. At the end of 1990 he became the chairman of the then strongest political entity - the Civic Forum. Following its demise in April 1991 he co-founded the Civic Democratic Party, of which he was chairman from its inception until December 2002. He won a parliamentary election with this party in June 1992 and became Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. In this role he shared in the ""Velvet Divorce"" of the Czechoslovak Federation and the foundation of an independent Czech Republic. In 1996 he successfully defended his post as Prime Minister in election to the Chamber of Deputies. Following the collapse of the governing coalition he tendered his resignation in November 1997. Following a forced general election in 1998 he became chairman of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech parliament for a four-year period.

On February 28, 2003 he was elected President of the Czech Republic. On February 15, 2008 he was elected President of the Czech Republic.

Vaclav Klaus is married to the economist Livia Klausova and has two sons and five grandchildren. His son Vaclav is the headmaster of a private grammar school in Prague, and his son Jan works as a financial analyst.

For many years in his youth Vaclav Klaus was top sportsman, playing basketball and volleyball, and also enjoys skiing and playing tennis. In his free time he enjoys reading fictitious literature and listening to music, in particular jazz.

He has published over 20 books on general social, political and economic themes, and has been awarded a number of international prizes and honorary doctorates from universities all over the world.",70601,Civic Democratic Party- ODS,No,Top ten,co-Founder,spoluzaložil,,Political advisor,Executive,President,,,2003-01-01,,1,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,0,,1,2003-01-01

LÃDER DEL MOVIMIENTO HONOR COLORADO : NaciÃ³ en AsunciÃ³n el 5 de julio de 1956. EstudiÃ³ en los colegios Goethe, Internacional y Cristo Rey. Luego viajÃ³ a Estados Unidos para proseguir su estudios, siguiendo la orientaciÃ³n de su padre, don RamÃ³n Telmo Cartes Lind, representante de Cessna para el Paraguay. Hizo carrera tÃ©cnica en Tulsa Oklahoma de Powerplant - Spartan School of Aero (motores de aviaciÃ³n) con una pasantÃ­a en la Cessna - Wichita, Kansas.
 Ya en el aÃ±o 1975, joven a los 19 aÃ±os, comenzÃ³ sus actividades de emprendimiento comercial. En 1989 se iniciÃ³ en el sector cambiario local, actividad que dio origen a Cambios Amambay, que en 1992 se convirtiÃ³ en Banco Amambay, hoy, una de las mÃ¡s sÃ³lidas del mercado financiero nacional.

INVERSIONES CON RSE : Luego en 1994/5 entra como socio en Tabacalera del Este S.A. (Palermo) y en 1996 se establece Tabacos del Paraguay S.A. como distribuidora de sus productos; En el aÃ±o 1999, Tabacalera del Este S.A. inicia el proyecto de cultivo de tabaco virginia y desarrollo de productores en Chore (departamento de San Pedro),donde posteriormente en el aÃ±o 2002, debido a la envergadura del proyecto forma la CompaÃ±Ã­a Agrotabacalera del Paraguay S.A. para dar seguimiento al mismo y donde actualmente da trabajo a mas de 1200 familias que realizan el cultivo del tabaco, de quienes compra para su posterior industrializaciÃ³n y comercializaciÃ³n.

Luego establece otras empresas que son lÃ­deres del mercado, entre las que se destaca Bebidas del Paraguay S.A. fabricante de los productos Pulp, Puro Sol y Watts. En MoisÃ©s Bertoni (departamento de CaazapÃ¡), formo la empresa Agrocitrus del Paraguay S.A., encargada del desarrollo del proyecto de cultivo de cÃ­tricos, donde emplea mano de obra de la zona, ayudando tambiÃ©n al desarrollo de la misma.
 Sus empresas lideran el mercado local siempre con un profundo sentido de  Responsabilidad Social Empresarial (RSE).
 
APOSTÃ“ TAMBIÃ‰N AL SECTOR GANADERO : Sus actividades empresariales no solo se centraron en los sectores comerciales y financieros, sino tambiÃ©n realizÃ³ inversiones en el sector ganadero, formando las empresas Ganadera Sofia S.A., Ganadera Chajha S.A. y Ganadera Las Pampas S.A., con amplio desarrollo y gestiÃ³n en cuanto a genÃ©tica, crÃ­a y engorde en sus establecimientos.

 Actualmente, las empresas del Grupo Cartes emplean mÃ¡s de 2.000 personas y estÃ¡n presentes en diversos sectores econÃ³micos, como la ganaderÃ­a, tabacos, bebidas, transporte, comercio y banca, entre otros. Su filosofÃ­a empresarial es la gestiÃ³n, mediante equipos profesionales de alta calidad, si escatimar en inversiÃ³n, innovaciÃ³n y capacitaciÃ³n constante de sus empleados.

 La organizaciÃ³n Great Place to WorkÂ® Institute Paraguay, distinguiÃ³ en el aÃ±o 2010, a una de sus firmas, Bebidas del Paraguay S.A. (Pulp), como una de las cinco mejores empresas para trabajar del paÃ­s.

SU PASIÃ“N, EL FÃšTBOL : Desde el aÃ±o 2001, al frente del Club Libertad, empieza una etapa de innovaciÃ³n y crecimiento, que posiciona al club entre los mÃ¡s grandes del paÃ­s y de AmÃ©rica, por su trayectoria internacional. Sus objetivos apuntan a la obtenciÃ³n de tÃ­tulos nacionales y el potenciamiento de las divisiones inferiores, asÃ­ como la lucha por un trofeo continental y la edificaciÃ³n de uno de los estadios mÃ¡s modernos de AmÃ©rica.
Todo eso con la mira puesta en poner Ã©nfasis en el respeto al ser humano y la realizaciÃ³n del trabajo con la mÃ¡xima calidad posible.

En los Ãºltimos 10 aÃ±os no sÃ³lo se invirtiÃ³ en el plantel e infraestructura, sino principalmente en la formaciÃ³n integral de los â€œchicosâ€ del Club que juegan en las divisiones inferiores y cuentan con una Residencia. Se trata de la primera y Ãºnica del paÃ­s, que cuenta con 10 dormitorios, sala de estudios, estar, duchas internas y externas, quincho, parrilla y sala de computaciÃ³n.

En el 2006 se inaugurÃ³ un amplio y moderno Centro de Entrenamiento del Club Libertad, ubicado frente al local de la ConfederaciÃ³n Sudamericana de FÃºtbol. Para Libertad, los futbolistas de las divisiones inferiores representan un objetivo de primerÃ­sima importancia, que se estÃ¡ encarando como pocas veces se ha visto en el paÃ­s, con un cuerpo tÃ©cnico especializado en las categorÃ­as respectivas, que trabaja con planificaciÃ³n a largo plazo, cuidando todos los detalles para una formaciÃ³n integral del atleta.

Logros deportivos de la â€œera Cartesâ€ en el club Libertad, se pueden citar: 7 campeonatos absolutos de la AsociaciÃ³n Paraguaya de FÃºtbol (APF), entre ellos, un histÃ³rico tetracampeonato en la historia del club gumarelo (2006, 2007, 2008 apertura y clausura); a nivel continental, se ganÃ³ el respeto de sus pares debido a las buenas actuaciones en Copa Libertadores, llegando en el 2006 a la instancia semifinal y en el 2007 a cuartos de final; obtuvo uno de los mÃ¡ximos reconocimientos, con la ubicaciÃ³n nÃºmero 15 de Libertad entre todos los clubes del mundo, en los aÃ±os 2006 y el 2007.

TambiÃ©n desempeÃ±a funciones directivas en la AsociaciÃ³n Paraguaya de FÃºtbol (APF), siendo su principal actividad  la DirecciÃ³n de Selecciones, funciÃ³n que le permite trabajar de cerca con la SelecciÃ³n Absoluta de FÃºtbol, equipo que llegÃ³ a un sitial nunca antes logrado en la Ãºltima Copa del Mundo de SudÃ¡frica 2010: cuartos de final.

SU INCURSIÃ“N EN POLÃTICA : En 2009 se hizo militante del Partido Colorado, inquieto por el curso polÃ­tico del paÃ­s bajo el gobierno izquierdista-liberal filo-chavista. FundÃ³ el movimiento Honor Colorado en noviembre de 2010, que hoy participa activamente en la vida partidaria de la AsociaciÃ³n Nacional Republicana (ANR) o Partido Colorado.

Tsvangirai is reported to have been an ardent Mugabe supporter and to have risen ""swiftly in the hierarchy"", eventually becoming one of the party's senior officials. He is also known for his role in the Zimbabwean trade Union movement, where he held the position of branch chairman of the Associated Mine Workers' Union and was later elected into the executive of the National Mine Workers' Union. In 1989 he became the Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, the umbrella trade union organization of Zimbabwe. 
Tsvangirai led the ZCTU away from the ruling ZANU-PF. As his power and that of the movement grew, his relationship with the Government deteriorated. He has survived at least three assassination attempts, including one in 1997 where unknown assailants burst into his tenth story office and tried to throw him out of the window
In 1999 Tsvangirai founded and organized the Movement for Democratic Change, an opposition party opposed to President Robert Mugabe and the ZANU-PF ruling party. He helped to defeat the February 2002 constitutional referendum, successfully campaigning against it along with the National Constitutional Assembly.
Tsvangirai lost the March 2002 Presidential Election to Mugabe. The election provoked widespread allegations that Mugabe had rigged the election through the use of violence, media bias, and manipulation of the voters' roll leading to abnormally high pro-Mugabe turnout in some areas. 

Morgan Tsvangirai has been a pain in the neck for Robert Mugabe since he became Secretary-General of the ZCTU in 1998 and withdrew the union from the grip of ZANU-PF. In the absence of a strong opposition party, following the merger of Mugabeâ€™s ZANU-PF and Joshua Nkomoâ€™s ZAPU in 1987, the labour movement was viewed as a political threat to the ruling party. There was even an assassination attempt on Tsvangirai in 1997 when a group of seven tried to throw him out of his 10th floor offices.
 
Under pressure to create an alternative to ZANU-PF Tsvangirai led the ZCTU and other civic organisations to form the Movement for Democratic Change in 1999.  He was also Chairman of the National Constitutional Assembly which led the campaign to vote against the proposed new constitution, drafted by Mugabe in February 2000, marking the first defeat Mugabe had suffered since taking power.  The MDC nearly kicked ZANU-PF out of office in the June 2000 parliamentary elections when it won 57 out of the 120 elected seats in parliament
 
Mugabeâ€™s answer was to unleash unprecedented violence against MDC supporters. Tsvangirai was arrested and charged with treason but later acquitted.  He challenged Mugabe in the presidential elections of 2002 and lost, but claimed the elections were rigged. There was a serious challenge to his leadership when his top lieutenants Welshman Ncube and Gibson Sibanda led a breakaway group that wanted to contest the 2005 senate elections, which Tsvangirai had said should be boycotted. The MDC had suffered a major loss in March 2005 when it won only 41 of the 120 contested seats. Ncube walked out with a majority of the Members of Parliament, virtually becoming the official opposition. Tsvangirai was forced to rebuild the party but Mugabe never shifted his eyes off Tsvangirai because he realised he had the support of the people and continued to harass and arrest him.
 
Tsvangirai surprised everyone, including himself, when he won the presidential elections in March 2008 but his indecision on what to do next, gave Mugabe a chance to reassert himself, dispute the results and call for a re-run. Mugabe unleashed a wave of violence that saw Tsvangirai flee the country, thus giving Mugabe breathing space. When Tsvangirai
 pulled out of the re-run as a consequence of the violence inflicted on his supporters,  Mugabe went ahead with the one-candidate election and was quickly sworn in.  He could not, however, hold the country together and was forced to sign a  power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai on 15 September.
 
Tsvangirai was sworn in on 11 February. Though he has been criticised for failing to confront Mugabe head-on after his election victory, he is steadily asserting his power. His long years in the labour movement where everything had to be agreed upon by consensus could be a major setback because at times he has to go with the decision of the majority when he might not personally agree with that decision.
 
He has also demonstrated that he can withstand tremendous pressure. He has managed to contain his supporters, civic society and donors who still want vengeance against ZANU-PF. He has remained constant in his support for the inclusive government.
 
He was not even swayed by the death of his wife on 6 March, four days before his 57th birthday, though there were cries of foul play. He has also managed to contain his Secretary-General, Tendai Biti, who seems to be still playing to the gallery.  His biggest problem could come from Bulawayo where there are already two distinct factions, one supporting him and the other his deputy, Thokozani Khupe. The infighting could play into the hands of Dumiso Dabengwa, who has revived the ZAPU, which once dominated the city and the entire Matabeleland.",82711,Movement For Democratic Change,No,Top ten,President,Prime Minister of Zimbabwe,,Party organization/administration,"Cabinet, Minister",,PM or equivalent,"English, Shona, Ndebele",2008-01-01,,0,,,,0,,Executive,Prime Minister,,2008-01-01,,0,,,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,0,,0,2008-01-01

Primeira-dama angolana com gabinete para apoiar projectos e campanhas sociais
AGÊNCIA LUSA / ANGOLA / 05 FEV 2018 / 15:28 H.
 Primeira-dama angolana com gabinete para apoiar projectos e campanhas sociais
A primeira-dama angolana, Ana Lourenço, vai ter um gabinete responsável por apoiar projectos, programas e campanhas para melhorar a condição de vida e o bem-estar da população, conforme decreto da Casa Civil do Presidente da República.

Segundo o decreto, de 29 de janeiro e ao qual a Lusa teve hoje acesso, o objectivo deste gabinete será contribuir, através da figura da primeira-dama, para um país “do qual os angolanos se possam orgulhar, resgatando os valores morais e sociais essenciais e desenvolvendo ações de ampla abrangência que produzam um impacto positivo na vida dos angolanos”.

O gabinete de Ana Lourenço terá uma equipa de nove pessoas, nomeadamente secretários e consultores, e um orçamento garantido por dotação dos Órgãos Auxiliares do Presidente da República (OAPR), determina o mesmo decreto.

“O papel da primeira-dama da República deve ser desempenhado com base num conjunto de princípios éticos, morais e sociais que são imanentes do simbolismo que acarreta aquela entidade, dentre os quais sobrelevam a cortesia, a responsabilidade, a solidariedade, o respeito, a ética, o rigor e a inovação”, justifica ainda o documento.

Entre outras competências, o gabinete da primeira-dama deverá actuar como “mobilizador no desenvolvimento de programas multissetoriais, nas áreas da economia local, desenvolvimento rural, assistência social, saúde, educação, cultura, arte e ambiente”, bem como promover “campanhas e programas para prevenir e atender às necessidades de emergência ou calamidades, prestando solidariedade e outros suportes”.

Também terá de identificar organizações interessadas em apoiar projectos para serem patrocinados pela primeira-dama, bem como apoiar entidades “que prestem especial atenção às crianças, jovens, mulheres e idosos”.

Eleita deputada na lista do MPLA nas eleições gerais angolanas de 23 de agosto, Ana Dias Lourenço, de 60 anos, acabou por suspender o mandato em outubro, acompanhando regularmente o marido, João Lourenço, Presidente da República, em visitas no país e ao estrangeiro.

Formada em economia, além de ministra do Planeamento durante o Governo do ex-Presidente José Eduardo dos Santos, Ana Lourenço foi quadro do Banco Mundial e do Banco Africano de Desenvolvimento.
