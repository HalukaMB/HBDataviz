# PyMedX - PubMed Access through Python

PyMedX is a Python library that provides access to PubMed through the PubMed
API.

## Why this library?

The PubMed API is not very well documented and querying it in a performant way
is too complicated and time consuming for researchers. This wrapper provides
access to the API in a consistent, readable and performant way.

## Features

This library takes care of the following for you:

- Querying the PubMed database (with the standard PubMed query language)
- Batching of requests for better performance
- Parsing and cleaning of the retrieved articles

## Examples

For full (working) examples have a look at the `examples/` folder in this
repository. In essence you only need to import the `PubMed` class, instantiate
it, and use it to query:

```python
from pymedx import PubMed
pubmed = PubMed(tool="MyTool", email="my@email.address")
results = pubmed.query("Some query", max_results=500)
```

## Notes on the API

The original documentation of the PubMed API can be found here:
[PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/developers/). PubMed
Central kindly requests you to:

> - Do not make concurrent requests, even at off-peak times; and
> - Include two parameters that help to identify your service or application to
>   our servers
>   - _tool_ should be the name of the application, as a string value with no
>     internal spaces, and
>   - _email_ should be the e-mail address of the maintainer of the tool, and
>     should be a valid e-mail address.
