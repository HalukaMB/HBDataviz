# Schwache Koalition / Weak coalition

This Pandas script was used to wrangle data from national polls. The idea behind it was to find out when the reigning parties were doing especially poor in the polls and what were the perceived problems at the time according to respondents.

For reproduction of this analysis, please first activate a local environment using pyenv and pip installing the packages saved in requirements.txt. Then use the scripts in the Wrangle folder. All other infors are in the Jupyter Script itself.
