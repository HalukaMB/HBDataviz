# Rough Introduction

This is the repo for all data and/or viz related projects that I will create for Handelsblatt.

The structure in each year folder is as follows:

* 00_StartSvelte: This is the playground for all Svelte related things.
* Template: This is the folder that reflects the general structure of all projects. 

	* Readme.md that describes the project.
	* "Background" contains all info regarding research, brainstorming whatsoever
	* "Wrangle" contains all files needed to reproduce the data wrangling bit. "data" with the raw data, "scripts" with the code, "vizsketches" with possible visualizations and the whole virtualenv structure with bin etc. Or possibly only a requirements.txt created using pip, to keep track of all the used libraries. 
	* "Viz" contains the necessary code to produce frontend graphics ready to be used in articles. These should mainly be based on Svelte and React.
